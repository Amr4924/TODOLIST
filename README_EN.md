# ToDoList Project

This project is a simple To-Do List application built with C++.

## Project Purpose
- Practice using compound data types like struct.
- Learn how to use vectors and handle user input/output.
- Build a simple text-based interface to add, view, and update tasks.

## Features
- Add new tasks with a title and priority.
- Display all tasks in an organized and colored format.
- Mark tasks as completed (Done).

## How does it work?
1. When you run the program, a menu with options appears.
2. The user can add new tasks, view tasks, or mark a task as completed.
3. The program continues until the user chooses to exit.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (g++ or any environment supporting C++11 or later is recommended)

## Notes
- This project is suitable for beginners in C++ programming.
- It does not use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP); it focuses on struct and basic input/output operations.
